    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>

        <li>2 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>

        <li>1 large onions, finely chopped</li>

        <li> 1 clove garlic, minced</li>

        <li> ½ tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>

        <li>1 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

        <li> ½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon plain yogurt</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>

        <li>½ (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>

        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>

        <li>½ pound basmati rice</li>

        <li>1 ¼ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

        <li>½ large onion, diced</li>

        <li>2 ½ pods cardamom</li>

        <li>1 ½ whole cloves</li>

        <li>½ (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>

        <li>½ pinch powdered saffron</li>

        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>

        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li>
        <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li>
        <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
    </ol>
