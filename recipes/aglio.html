    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A classic, light yet filling way of enjoying pasta</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound uncooked spaghetti</li>

        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>

        <li>3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>

        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>⅛ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>

        <li>½ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>

        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</li>
        <li>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li>
        <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
