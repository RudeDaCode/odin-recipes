    <p>Mushrooms stuffed with a savoury, cheesy filling</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 whole fresh mushrooms</li>

        <li>½ tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

        <li>½ tablespoon minced garlic</li>

        <li>½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>

        <li> ⅛ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon onion powder</li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>

        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel; carefully break off stems. Chop stems extremely fine, discarding the tough end of stems.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and chopped mushroom stems; fry until any moisture has evaporated, taking care not to burn garlic. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne. The mixture will be very thick.</li>
        <li>Use a teaspoon to fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of stuffing. Arrange mushroom caps on the prepared cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the mushrooms are piping hot, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
